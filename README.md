## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Lesson
Used CRUD skills to manipulate the DOM for what users entered into the the textarea with an option to edit their posts. Users are also able to completely delete the posts.

### Continued development
Will add logos and timestamps for each post added to create a full social media app.
